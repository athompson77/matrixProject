Part 1: Hilbert Matrix Instructions

To calculate the solution to Ax=b using LU factorization type
java solve_lu_b into the command console including both of the 
file names for the A matrix and b matrix sperated by spaces. 

To calculate the solution to Hx=b using LU factorization type
java solve_lu_b into the command console followed by an integer
for the dimension of the Hilbert matrix you would like, the file
name for the b Matrix, and the letters hil.
