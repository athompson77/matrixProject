Power Method: Readme

The power method program is very straightforward and the prompts given on execution are likewise. However, to ensure the code runs properly, do the following:

Step 1: Open the command prompt and be sure your working directory is the same as power_method.java
Step 2: Ensure that your computer has the most recent Java Development Kit (JDK)
Step 3: Use the command "javac power_method.java" to ensure that a corresponding class file is present.
Step 4: Use the command "java power_method" to run the code, and follow the prompts

NOTICES: The program only takes in square matrices. Do not input augmented or non-square matrices.

The error tolerance (or digits of accuracy) must be input as a decimal (ex. 0.00001)

Finally, if the program takes more than 75 iterations to approximate an eigenvalue, it will inform you that it could not calculate it within the iteration limit.
